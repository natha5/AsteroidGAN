To run the system, Python version 3.11 is required (due to use of features not present in earlier versions). Also, the following Python packages are required to be installed:
•	Numpy (should be pre-installed)
•	Pandas
•	Keras
•	Tensorflow
•	PyGame
These should easily be installed using the command: pip install <package name> on the command line.


To experience the full system, simply run the file ‘visualise_data.py’. If the user wishes to change the view displayed, the button ‘view orbit’ should be clicked.
